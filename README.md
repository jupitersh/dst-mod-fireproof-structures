# Fireproof Structures

## Overview

This is a mod for the game of Don't Starve Together which is available in the Steam Workshop. 

Are you afraid of wild fire that consumes your home base without any hesitation when you are not at home?

Now your structures (except the Hay Wall and Directional Sign) are fireproof.

It's better if you combine the mod [Invincible Structures](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=503795626) with this.
