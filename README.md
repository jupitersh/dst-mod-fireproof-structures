# Fireproof Structures

## Overview

This is a mod for the game of Don't Starve Together which is available in the Steam Workshop. 

Are you afraid of wild fire that consumes your home base without any hesitation when you are not at home?

Now your structures (except the Hay Wall and Directional Sign) are fireproof.

It's better if you combine the mod [Invincible Structures](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=503795626) with this.

## Changelog

**Version 1.2.0**

- Add More structures.
- More configuration.

**Version 1.1**

- Adding plants to the fireproof list, such as sapling, grass, berrybush,etc. The function is turned off by default.
	> Attention: there is a bug that the ice flingomatic will keep drop the ice ball to the plants if you turn this function on. I am searching for a solution now.
